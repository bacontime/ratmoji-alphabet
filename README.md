An alphanumeric COLRv0 font made from Twemoji's rat emoji üêÄüêÄüêÄ

Find the original repo on [Github here](https://github.com/bacontime/ratmoji-alphabet).

In [the font folder](https://github.com/bacontime/ratmoji-alphabet/tree/main/font), you can download a ttf file which should work in all modern browsers. 
(Support for color fonts in other applications is spotty.)
The other folders in the repo contain the source files for the glyphs.

<div class="rattest">
Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.
Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
